            <p>
                <strong>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam</strong> (15 October 1931 – 27 July 2015) was an Indian
                aerospace scientist
                who served as the 11th president of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil
                Nadu and studied physics and aerospace engineering. He spent the next four decades as a scientist and
                science administrator, mainly at the DRDO and ISRO, and was intimately involved in India's civilian
                space programme and military missile development efforts. He thus came to be known as the "Missile Man
                of India" for his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology.

                He also played a pivotal organizational, technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear
                tests in 1998.
